Dear Team,

I have used Html,css and js to achieve this calculator, In the html  I have used div's , buttons and select to get the values and in css I have used flex properties and some color and font designs,
In Javascript I have used queryselector to get the elements of the html and value to get the value of the tags and calculated the formula by storing inside a varibale and displayed.
